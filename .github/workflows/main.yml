# This file describes the GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration of CoupledL2

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ master, chi-coupledl2 ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, chi-coupledl2 ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  tl-test_L2:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Environments
    env:

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
